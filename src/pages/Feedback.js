                    Very comfortable and warm room. Plenty of electric sockets 
                    to charge my devices and work with my laptop. Great TV and really excellent hot shower, 
                    so easy to use. Friendly staff and fantastic breakfasts. I love the Karelian pies. The hotel 
                    is very central within easy reach of shops, eating places and metro, trams, buses and the Central Station. 
                    I will certainly be back."</p>

                    team has always been friendly, patient and helpful. That impressed me the most. No matter what time of day or night, 
                    you could turn to them with all your concerns. On my next stays, I will definitely check into Hotel Arthur again.

                    Our Valentine's Day Offer was a wonderful treat - a historic Jugend-style room in the 9th floor, over the roofs of Helsinki. The room itself had a nice red brick wall, a king size bed and all the necessary amenities.
                    The view was great, we could see e.g. the huge clock tower of the main Railwaystation and other towers. The sunset was breathtaking in the winter time (no Nordic Lights, though).
                    We had a sauna of our own with two showers. 80 degrees Celsius was just right for us.
                    Breakfast was abundant with porridge, various cereals and yoghurts, fresh fruit, crisp vegetables, a selection of Finnish bread, Karelian pies, etc. The coffee and juices were good to Finnish taste, too.
                    We wish to thank especially our waitress Noora (on 12th Feb) in the breakfast service. She's got a cheerful personality with a great attitude to work and customers. All the best for her and hope to see you again in the future."</p>

                    Can be easily reached and most of the shopping centers and sights are nearby. The room was 
                    comfortable and I'm a big fan of scandinavian bathroom structures, they are very practical altogether. 
                    The breakfast was delicious and the hotel was very kind to pack us a breakfast when we were checking out 
                    earlier than the restaurant's opening hour. The staff was also kind and helpful with anything, with perfect 
                    English, so there were no miscommunication issues."</p>
